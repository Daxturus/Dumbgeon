# Dumbgeon
A game where you draw crappy art to use as figures/characters/objects and manage the stats of those figures/characters/objects yourself. Kind of like an easy but hands-on DND tool, except it probably doesn't have to be used for just dungeons and dragons.


Sorry this is so unbelievably wrong for a Github repo. The only thing of interest is a text file containing HTML code.
I simply wanted to get this out there, on the internet, so I could say I was the first guy to make this.
I had an inexplicable paranoia that my code would be stolen before I could unlicense it.
Now that that is out of the way, you are free to do anything with this.
Use it. Stream it. Modify it. Share it with friends. Sell it to a triple-A game studio and have them make Dumb Doodle Dungeon VII. The world is your oyster.

Name pending. Dumbgeon is pretty dumb. I was also thinking Dunceon, but it doesn't roll off the tongue.
